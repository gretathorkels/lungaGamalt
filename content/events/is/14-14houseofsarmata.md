descr1: Kiki House of Sarmata is a unique community of dancers and performers as well as a family of choice cultivating the Polish Ballroom. Kiki House of Sarmata is the first international ballroom collective founded by the leaders of the Warsaw ballroom - Bożna Wydrowska and Danil Vitkovski in 2019. Although the name of the house was inspired by Sarmatism, an ethnocultural concept that was once a central aspect of Polish culture - the collective is very ethnically diverse. It includes people not only from Poland, but also from Ukraine, Armenia, Belarus, and South Africa.
descr2: The essence of the house is to celebrate the uniqueness and ourness by queering Sarmatian history and today's reality. In addition to the significant presence at Polish and foreign balls, the collective can boast of cooperation and numerous projects, including with the American i-D, HBO, Vogue Polska, Answear, and  Reebok.
