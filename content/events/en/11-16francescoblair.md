time: TBA
name: Stored Void (Francesco Fabris & Blair Alexander)
type: Exhibition
where: Silo
descr1: One of the LungA exhibitions this year is a collaborative installation by Italian visual artist Francesco Fabris and Canadian cinematographer Blair Alexander. The installation will be a work in progress from its opening and throughout the festival. Where the duo will play with light, sound and shadows of the Silo tank in Seyðisfjörður. A vast and dark echo chamber with a lot of potential to explore the qualities of place, time and space.
descr2: A meditation on absence and presence, the void out of a presumed necessity in a place that’s been built by humans to be filled and store future needs, but that’s now re-used without any need for them to be there. An exercise of displacement in a place that has been deprived from its primal function while allowing the natural sound properties of its material to come alive and be experienced from a new perspective.
descr3: Constantly realtime spatialized soundscapes and lights will interact with the architecture of the structure shaping into a site-specific piece about place as time and space.
