name: Karaoke!
type: Fun!
where: Kaffi Lára
descr1: Are you ready for the most amazing karaoke you have ever taken part in???
descr2: Because you should! Everything is allowed as long as you take a deep breath in and dare yourself to step on the stage. Alone or hand in hand with your bestie you are the star of the evening. The star of your life. Glittering and shining like a silvery salmon you take a look at the screaming projection behind you as the audience smiles in excitement. You are not supposed to know how to sing, cause everyone can. Release your stiffness, release your power and BOOM, time goes slower and the stage is yours. DO IT for you, DO IT cause you can and you should, or simply do it to impress your new LungA crush that you know is in the crowd.
descr3: As performance artist Sigrún Gyða aka DJ AMMA DEUS leads you towards your destiny of being a karaoke star, you are invited to LungA’s greatest karaoke so far.
