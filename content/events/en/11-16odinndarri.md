It is no other than the established tattoo artist Óðinn Darri who has throughout his career tattooed a plethora of people in the country as well as the majority of the individuals in the underground scene in Reykjavík. In the process establishing himself as  one of the better known emerging tattoo artists in the country.
descr2: Óðinn Darri is, first and foremost, an artist  from Reykjavík and has been tattooing since the year 2014, he first “officially” hit the scene with opening the tattoo parlor Mall Rats Tattoo in 2017. He is one of the owners of Streets Rats Tattoo which he runs today with a couple of his peers. His designs are black, bold and timeless.

Óðinn will without a doubt be super buzy keeping up with the demand from the festival’s participants and guests. A portion of the proceeds will go to a charity chosen by the tattooee.
