title: Fjord of Words — Impostor Poet's Writing Workshop
teacher1: Imposter Poets
teacher2: Ragnheiður Harpa Leifsdóttir
teacher3: Melkorka Ólafsdóttir
length: 5 day workshop
about1: We are surrounded by mountains. We are surrounded by the sea. We are surrounded by words. But can we use words to say what we need and desire? Do words cover all the wonders, all the mess? Can they surprise, get behind us, make us pause? Imposter Poets have always gone their own way in approaching words, using words. Their methods have aroused curiosity and surprise, and in the workshop, participants get to know them first-hand. Words are allowed to arise, reflected by the environment, archetypes and other poets. They will be stolen and returned and stolen again. They will be directed in all directions, they will be told or not told. Written, printed or dissolved in the wind.
about2: We look for words in nature, research the act of writing, work with addresses, rituals, poems, prose, conversations and flow. Participants will learn about various aspects of creative writing and learn to use the various tools from the author's toolbox. You will work with triggers and flowing writing, the artist's daily life and challenges - to get inspiration and learn technology, reading and sharing. Participants in the workshop will learn about self-publishing, create books and look at the performance involved in reading.
about3: The working methods of Imposter Poets are based on trust and solidarity. In the collective we work with a stopwatch, write and share what we call mash. With conversation and togetherness, something new and mysterious is always born.
