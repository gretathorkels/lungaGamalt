title: ‘You don’t look like a dancer’
teacher1: 155 - eenvijfvijf
length: 5 day workshop
about1: For a long time we have been interested in authentic and human movement. In this workshop we will, together with you, try to discover what makes us dance and move differently, and what makes us dance and move the same? Can you be completely different while looking completely the same? Or do our looks, and ‘what kind of people’ we are, define what we can be, and what we can achieve?
about2: Don’t get too comfortable, we will do some hard dance training, practice handstands and flips and work hard on choreography, but there will be a place for your moves, your music and yourself this week.
aboutteacher1: 155 is a group that has been dancing and making shows together since they were children. With their roots in breaking, they started training in contemporary dance, vogueing, pantsula and other dance styles.
aboutteacher2: Now they perform in Holland and other countries with their dance/theater pieces, which often involve video. And their short films are shown in (dance)film festivals around the world.
