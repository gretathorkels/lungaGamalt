descr1: Even though originally formed in 2012 as a thrash metal/disco concept, CYBER is now known as the ongoing experimental hip-hop and electronic project of Salka Valsdóttir and Jóhanna Rakel. The band was named after a lipstick that Salka and Jóhanna both found themselves rocking when they became best friends at sixteen. Even though the lipstick is now totally lame the band has flourished. Releasing 5 projects in the last 5 years, CYBER has now established themselves as a leading force of fun and experimental live performances. For their latest album ‘VACATION’ CYBER won the Icelandic Music Awards for best hip-hop/rap album.
