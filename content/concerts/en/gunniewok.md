descr1: Gunni Ewok has been around the Icelandic dance music scene for more than a minute now. First getting noticed when he joined drum & bass crew Breakbeat.is back in 2002 where he was a resident DJ on their monthly club nights and weekly radio show. Breakbeat.is started pushing more of the experimental side of drum & bass and then later early dubstep and the general UK Bass sounds as well as the Chicago based Footwork/Juke sounds. Alongside this you could find him playing house, techno, disco , hip hop, r&b and more experimental sets around Reykjavík. In 2013 Gunni Ewok and the Breakbeat.is crew decided to call it quits and shortly there after Gunni Ewok started Plútó with like minded DJs looking to push things forward. Plútó is a weekly radio show that has been going since 2014 as well as hosting regular club nights dedicated to the functional yet interesting parts of dance music be it new or old. So you can expect a healthy mix of bass heavy dance music across multiple genres when Gunni Ewok steps up behind the decks.
