descr1: russian.girls started out as a solo project of Guðlaugur Hörðdal Einarsson in 2011, but later became a platform for him and his friends to make music. Today russian.girls is known as a trio, as Tatjana Dís Aldísar and Gylfi Freeland Sigurðsson joined the project in 2016. Together they've released four EPs, most recently under the Icelandic/German techno label bbb recors. As once described, russian.girls make music that is “entirely their own” surprising their listeners with each release.
