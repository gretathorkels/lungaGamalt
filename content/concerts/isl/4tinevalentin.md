descr1: Tine Valentin is a Copenhagen-based DJ who constructs her sets around an electro foundation, though it is not unusual for them to span genres like techno, house and breaks among others. Inspired by the music she loves, she tries to find her own way to make the dance floor a good place to be. Not a promoter, no producer, just a music nut lucky enough to get to play her favourite music out loud.
